Comments:

For my handling notifications I decided to use a message queue similar to last 
project except using more variables in the structure for the different types
of messages and who the messages were going to and from based on an integer. Also
the type of message (request, release, termiantion) is determined by an integer
being sent in the message for the msgDetails field. Oss sends messages to the children
based on their specific pid.

For deadlock detection, I used the example from the notes to determine if there is a 
deadlock. In that deadlock function, I included the resolution code to resolve deadlocks.
If it is determined that a process or processes are deadlocked, then it will start by
killing and releasing the resources of the lowest generated process id. So for example
if P3 and P16 are deadlocked it would start by killing and releasing all the resouces of P3. 
After killing and releasing P3's resources, I run the deadlock function again to determine 
if there is still a deadlock even after releasing P3's resources. If there is, then next P16
would be killed and it's resources released. If there wasn't still a deadlock, then the program
would go back to normal execution, and continue granting, releasing or terminating based on
requests.
